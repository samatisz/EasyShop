# Hearth Shire Home Goods Online Store


<b>Using SQL, IntelliJ, and Postman this project is the store website for Hearth Shire Home Goods. The store is a home goods store specifically for Hobbit Folk and Shirelings from J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Hobbit books. The store offers a variety of supplies such as furniture, bedding, gardening supplies, and paint to make a hobbit hole your home. 
The categories in the store are: 
1. Home Decore and Kitchen: Even the smallest person can change the course of the furniture. We have everything to make your hobbit hole into a hobbit home.
2. Paint: Every hobit hole must look exquisite. We offer a wide variety of paint colors for all homes.
3. Gardening Essentials: If there is one things hobbits love more than a good mug of ale and a fresh cheese wheel, it's gardening.</b>

## Future Work

Outline potential future enhancements or functionalities you might consider adding:

- I would like to complete the shoppoing cart so that the website can become fully functional
- It would be nice to learn more front end coding such as JavaScript so that I can do more to the website cosmetically
